# Data Structures
This program gives you an opportunity to work with lists, double lists, stacks and queues. Let's speak about Lists.

## Singly Linked list

Singly linked list - is a dynamic data structure, each element of which is with the help of a pointer binds to the next element (in unconnected or unilaterally linked lists) or to the next and the previous elements (in dovetailed or bipartite linked lists). The list has a "head" - the first one element and "tail" - the last element. We can do a lot of operations with lists. They are pushback, leftpop, pop, remove, sorting, insert elements, head on tail.
We can do the same opetations with double lists. But in addition you can find the elem from right.

## Stack

Stack - a kind of linear list, data structure, which operates on the basis of "the last one has come - the first has gone." Speaking about stacks, we can do more less operations. We can only do such operation as - pushback and pop.
It is the same situation with queues. - Queue - dynamic data structure, working on the principle "first came - the first has gone." The queue has a head and tail (or the beginning and the end).

Let's speak about the operations in details. Pushback - it adds the elem to the type of data. Pop - it deletes the elem of the type of data. Remove - it removes two elems. Sorting - it sorts the type of data. Insert - it inserts the elem to the type of data.

Speaking about authors: Danylo was dealing with queues; Olena was dealing with stacks; Maxym was dealing with lists and double lists; Zakhar was dealing with arrays. In addition he did the main work, and all this program is based on his work.
